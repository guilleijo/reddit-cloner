## reddit-cloner
Migrate your subreddits subscriptions to a new account. Simply authenticate with your old account, logout, then authenticate with the new one and that's it.

## Live site
Go to [reddit-cloner](https://reddit-cloner.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation
Reddit does not allow to change your username, you need to create a new account. The problem is that you will want to follow the subreddits that you already are subscribed to and can be a lot of work to go through them one by one. Using RedditCloner you can migrate all your subscriptions easily.
